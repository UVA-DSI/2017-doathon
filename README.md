# Welcome to the DSI Do-a-thon

Doathons bring together diverse participants to get things done &mdash; openly, collaboratively and quickly. The event centers around participants (no monologues!), and focused attention to doable projects, where collaboration, discovery and preservation are made easy. To get an idea, take a look at a [previous doathon](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon) and [see what we did](https://github.com/sparcopen/Open-Research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).

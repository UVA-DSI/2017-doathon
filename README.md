# Watch this space

Up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center

# Give us a hand

If you love this idea, and want to help contribute, see [here](https://github.com/sparcopen/do-a-doathon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) from some guidance.

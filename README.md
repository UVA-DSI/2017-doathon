# Welcome to the first DSI Do-a-thon

Doathons bring together diverse participants to get things done &mdash; openly, collaboratively and quickly. The event centers around participants (no monologues!) and focused attention to doable projects, where collaboration, discovery and preservation are made easy. To get an idea, take a look at a [previous doathon](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon) and [see what was done there](https://github.com/sparcopen/Open-Research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).

# When?

18-19 November 2017 (Saturday & Sunday; 9am-4:30pm on both days)

# Where?

At [OpenGrounds](https://opengrounds.virginia.edu/) (in the [Barringer Wing](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=20/38.03405/-78.49981)), 1400 University Ave, Charlottesville, VA 22903.

# What?

The theme of this event will be [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data), i.e. data that have been shared with no or minimal restrictions on reuse. 

On day 1, the focus will be more on open research data, on day 2 on open data from the city of Charlottesville, Albemarle county and the state of Virginia. For details, go to [data.md](data.md).

# Who?

The event is for people interested in open data &mdash; providers, aggregators or users of open data, data visualizers, data journalists, user experience designers, educators or anyone working towards data open.

It is organized by the [Data Science Institute](http://dsi.virginia.edu/) at the University of Virginia.

# How to prepare

* Let us know you're coming (we'll post instructions soon).
* Think about what you can contribute to or what you would like to learn at the event. For instance, 
  - if you are providers of open data, let us know about what people are doing with the data or what ideas you have on what could be done with the data
  - if you have data but it's not open yet, consider making (some of) it open, or learning what this would entail
  - if you are looking for open data on a specific matter, let us know, and we can explore together where such data might be available and whether and how it could be made open in a way that suits your use case

# What's next?

We are seeing this doathon as a prototype for a series of similar events to be held in or around Charlottesville on a variety of topics, and to follow up on projects from previous ones. If you are interested in helping organize a future one, please get in touch.

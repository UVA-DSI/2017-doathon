# Do a Doathon

## Watch this space
The guide isn't finished yet, we're still building it. You can see a bare-bones version [here](https://github.com/sparcopen/do-a-doathon/tree/master/guide).

Up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center

## Give us a hand

If you love this idea, and want to help contribute, see [here](https://github.com/sparcopen/do-a-doathon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for some guidance. We're tracking todo's in [issues](https://github.com/sparcopen/do-a-doathon/issues).

## Roadmap

See [milestones & issues](https://github.com/sparcopen/do-a-doathon/issues) for our up to date roadmap.

## Goals (v.1)

1. Create a version of hackathons that are collaborative, more approachable and value more diverse contributions explicitly.
2. Encourage events which are more action focused and that build more community.
3. Experiment with bringing lots of ideas from hackathons, unconferences, OpenCon / Mozilla, satellites together.

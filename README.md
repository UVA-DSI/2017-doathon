# Do a Doathon

## Watch this space
The guide isn't finished yet, we're still building it.

Up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center

## Give us a hand

If you love this idea, and want to help contribute, see [here](https://github.com/sparcopen/do-a-doathon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) from some guidance. We're tracking todo's in [issues](https://github.com/sparcopen/do-a-doathon/issues).

## Roadmap

See [milestones & issues](https://github.com/sparcopen/do-a-doathon/issues) for our up to date roadmap.

## Goals (v.1)

1 Create a version of hackathons that are collaborative, more approachable and values more contributions explicitly.
2 Encourage events which are more action focused and that build more community.
3 Experiment with bringing lots of ideas from hackathons, unconferences, opencon / mozilla, together under one roof.

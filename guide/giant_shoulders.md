In here can go general ideas / issues from previous events for use in your events!

Ideas:

* Trying to find / reuse an [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) dataset
* Building engaging (and open) visualizations of open research data
* Adding some field-specific examples to [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) lessons
* Building a software library (Python module/ R package/ Ruby gem etc.) to facilitate access to and processing of open data from specific sources
* Building a set of [Wikidata SPARQL queries](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples) for a specific field
* Harvesting data from the supplementary files of scholarly publications ([example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Open_Access_Media_Importer_Bot))
* Participating in research-related activities that others are planning for [Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/)
* A data-centric walk around the neighbourhood
* Improving documentation for any of the above
* Adding a “research data” section to the [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/)
* Improving Wikipedia pages around or with open research data
* Writing data management plans
* Writing data-centric grant proposals
* Make your own data FAIR
* Test out reproducible computational tools such as [Binder](http://mybinder.org/), [R-Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) (see [this list of resources](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/blob/master/reproducible_open_data_resources.md))
* Prototype a tool to leverage the open datasets in open-access journals like [eLife](http://elifesciences.org/) or in repositories ([Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [Dataverse](http://dataverse.org/), etc)
* Prototype a tool to make it easy for researchers to share/discover/consume comprehensive, open and FAIR data
* Devise a mechanism to incentivise deposition, review and reuse of datasets
* Trying to contribute to a citizen science project as a group
* Trying to re-run an analysis based on the original or on new data
* Document data, metadata, standards, use or reuse
* Make a movie/ song / other piece of art about any of the above

* How to identify issues to work on
  - Get participants to come up with new ideas and post them before the event
  - Look around for ideas that have been posted elsewhere

* How to match ideas and participants
* How to call for help
* How to communicate between on-site and remote participants
* How to document what has been done and learned
* When to have breaks and whether and how to structure them

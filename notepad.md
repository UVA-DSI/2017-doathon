# Homepage brainstorming & experimentation

Doathons bring together diverse participants to advance open, openly, quickly. The event centers around participants(no speakers needed!), and projects on Github where collaboration, discovery and preservation are made easy. Once you've got a room booked, you're free to focus on what matters - attracting awesome participants and helping them work together.

## phrases I kinda like

Events done right.
Events done open.
Get more from your event.
You run events to educate, connect, and change the world - but the format fails you.
Don't let the format fail you.
Stop guessing what your attendees want, just give them space to find it.

## breaking down doathons

| Doathons |
| --- | --- |
| &#10003;| Works with any # of attendees |
| &#10003;| Low budget|
| &#10003;| Remote participation|
| &#10003;| High impact|
| &#10003;| Great for first time event host|
| &#10005;| Speakers|
| &#10005;| Surveys|
| &#10005;| Planning|

## Why bother

| For Attendees  | For Organizers  |
|---|---|
| Learn by doing, not listening  | Engage & build your community, not a speakers list  |
| Break networking out of breaks  | Organize projects, not the event |
| Get motivated & helped | Leave a record of your event |
| | Lower bars to contribution |
| | Get a space, get attendees. Done. |
| Engage remotely, feel the tempo |  |

## trifecta

| Easy & Fast | Impactful | Inclusive & participatory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Confirm a room, and you're good to go. Programming that works out the box, with no speakers to arrange. Do the follow up & feedback needed on the day. | Count your impact in projects, not tweets. Let people learn and network by doing, not listening. | We can't all hack, but we can all do! Bring people together in the room, or online, through open workflows. Stop guessing what your attendees want, just give them space to find it. |

## The first Doathon: a case study

The first doathon was born out of a need for an inclusive, easy event that focused on getting things done. Tired of focusing on getting speakers, and events that leave no trace, we decide to focus on working openly on Github.

### What is a do-a-thon? (original)

It's an event centered around:
* getting things done (including documenting them), and building on what has come before
* low-fi, informal participatory programming
* encouraging remote participation, and diverse in-person participation
* inclusive activities (not just "hacking" on code) encouraged

It's also an event with a soundtrack: [listen.hatnote.com](http://listen.hatnote.com/#en,fa,ar,sa,es,de,ru,jp,zh,ko) (you can configure that).

### Why do a do-a-thon? (original)

You're bored of listening to talks and other monologues, and think it's more important to use your time to engage with others and to work together on issues you care about. You want an event format that supports that and is easy to create.

### Who can do a do-a-thon (original)

Anyone!

# Now it's your turn

# Participant quotes

... need some of these!

# things conference organizers often hear / know about their events but don't pay attention to

* participants get most value from attendees, usually in a few minutes of breaks
* we often don't follow up how we plan (we're too exhausted, and feel like we're done)
* the same people attend most events. The "usual crowd". They're bored.

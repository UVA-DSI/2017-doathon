# About

This page provides some basic information around the data and resources that could be useful for doathon projects. 

# Definition

The focus of this event is on open data as defined by the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/), which can be summarized as 
> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).

# Scope

We are interested in 
- data along its entire life cycle ([overview](http://data.library.virginia.edu/data-management/lifecycle/))
  - from making plans to capture data to the actual data capture, processing and sharing of data, integration across different sources, updates, citations and other forms of reuse.
- metadata
  - again all along the cycle, including ontologies and cases when original data may not be available any more
- other topics related to data
  - infrastructure
  - policies
  - education
  - usage
  - ethics
  - visualizations
  - discoverability

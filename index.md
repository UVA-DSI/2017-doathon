# What is a Doathon?

![London Doathon](https://github.com/sparcopen/do-a-doathon/blob/master/assets/doathon_london.jpg?raw=true)

# Brainstorming bits & bobs

&#10003;
&#10005;

Events done right.
Events done open.

## Why bother

| For Attendees  | For Organizers  |
|---|---|
| Learn by doing, not listening  | Engage & build your community, not a speakers list  |
| Break networking out of breaks  | Organize projects, not the event |
| Get motivated & helped | Leave a record of your event |
| | Lower bars to contribution |
| | Get a space, get attendees. Done. |
| Engage remotely, feel the tempo |  |


| Easy & Fast | Impactful | Inclusive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blurb | Blurb | Remote / name / open |

## The first Doathon: a case study

The first doathon was born out of a need for an inclusive, easy event that focused on getting things done. Tired of focusing on getting speakers, and events that leave no trace, we decide to focus on working openly on Github.

# What is a Doathon?

![London Doathon](https://github.com/sparcopen/do-a-doathon/blob/master/assets/doathon_london.jpg?raw=true)

# Brainstorming bits & bobs

Events done right.
Events done open.

## Why bother

| For Attendees  | For Organizers  |
|---|---|
| Learn by doing, not listening  | Engage & build your community, not a speakers list  |
| Break networking out of breaks  | Organize projects, not the event |
| Get motivated & helped | Leave a record of your event |
| | Lower bars to contribution |
| | Get a space, get attendees. Done. |
| Engage remotely, feel the tempo |  |


| Easy & Fast | Impactful | Inclusive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blurb | Blurb | Remote / name / open |

## The first Doathon: a case study

The first doathon was born out of a need for an inclusive, easy event that focused on getting things done. Tired of focusing on getting speakers, and events that leave no trace, we decide to focus on working openly on Github.

### What is a do-a-thon? (original)

It's an event centered around:
* getting things done (including documenting them), and building on what has come before
* low-fi, informal participatory programming
* encouraging remote participation, and diverse in-person participation
* inclusive activities (not just "hacking" on code) encouraged

It's also an event with a soundtrack: [listen.hatnote.com](http://listen.hatnote.com/#en,fa,ar,sa,es,de,ru,jp,zh,ko) (you can configure that).

### Why do a do-a-thon? (original)

You're bored of listening to talks and other monologues, and think it's more important to use your time to engage with others and to work together on issues you care about. You want an event format that supports that and is easy to create.

### Who can do a do-a-thon (original)
